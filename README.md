# rice
My **rice**. Basically dotfiles, configs and all I need just to keep track of
everything.


Any suggestions are welcome.

# Firefox
If you want to use firefox with a "_toggleable bar_" (with Control+l or F6),
all files that you need are on the directory firefox. First install Firefox.
Open Firefox. On addres bar type `about:config`. Search for
`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and enable it by changing
'False' to 'True'. Close all instances of firefox. On your system, go to
`~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXXX.default/`, where "_XXXXXXXX_" are random
characters, inside that directory move the `chrome` directory from this
repository to your system.


_If you have a profile folow these steps. Instead of
'~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXXX.default/' it should be
'~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXXX.YOURPROFILE/' , where YOURPROFILE is the name of a
profile.
